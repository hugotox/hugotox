### Hey there!

My name is Hugo. I've been developing web applications for over a decade, and I enjoy shipping features and solving problems.

I have come full circle: starting with the LAMP stack, having a brief affair with ASP.NET, then moving back to open-source tools with Django. I later got into SPAs with Angular (v1) until I discovered React—and I’ve never looked back.
